Setup

Let $(W_n)_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ be a sequence of i.i.d. $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ random variables indexed by the integers
$\mathbb{Z}$ (a doubly infinite sequence).

We consider an autoregressive process of order 2 (an AR(2)-process) that solves the autoregression
$$X_n - b_1 X_{n-1} - b_2 X_{n-2} = W_n.$$
The *characteristic polynomial* is 
$$q(z) = 1 - b_1 z - b_2 z^2.$$

If $q$ has (complex) roots outside of the closed unit disc there is an $R > 1$ and a 
sequence $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ such that 
$$\frac{1}{q(z)} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k z^k$$
for all complex $z$'s with $|z| \leq R$. This is a result from complex analysis. The function 
$1/q$ is holomorphic in a disc with radius $R > 1$, and is thus given by its Taylor series. You can take this 
for granted, if you don't know about complex analysis. 

When $q$ has roots outside of the closed unit disc, the infinite moving average process
$$X_n = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k W_{n-k}$$
is a solution to the autoregression. It is weakly stationary meaning that there is an 
autocovariance function $\gamma : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that 
$$\text{cov}(X_n, X_k) = \gamma(n - k)$$
for all $n \geq k \in \mathbb{N}$. The autocorrelation function is 
$$\rho(k) = \frac{\gamma(k)}{\sigma^2}$$
where $\sigma^2 = \gamma(0)$. 

By using the autoregression we find that 
$$\gamma(1) = \text{cov}(X_3, X_2) = \text{cov}(b_1 X_2 + b_2 X_1, X_2) = b_1 \sigma^2 + b_2 \gamma(1)$$
and 
$$\gamma(2) = \text{cov}(X_4, X_2) = \text{cov}(b_1 X_3 + b_2 X_2, X_2) = b_1 \gamma(1) + b_2 \sigma^2.$$
Isolating the correlation $\rho(1) = \gamma(1)/\sigma^2$ in the first equation gives that 
$$\rho(1) = \frac{b_1}{1 - b_2}.$$
If we plug this into the second equation, we find that 
$$\rho(2) = b_2 + \frac{b_1^2}{1 - b_2}.$$
When the roots are outside the closed unit disc, these equations give a one-to-one correspondance between the 
two $b$-coefficients and the two first autocorrelations.
