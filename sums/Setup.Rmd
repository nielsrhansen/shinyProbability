Setup
-----

In this example we consider a fixed sequence $a_k \geq 0$, a sequence of 
i.i.d. random variables $Z_1, Z_2, \ldots$ with  
$$P(Z_k = 1) = P(Z_k = -1) = \frac{1}{2},$$
and we let 
$$S_n = 2 + \sum_{k=1}^n Z_k a_k.$$
That is, $S_n$ is the sum of $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ with random signs.  

A possible interpretation is that we play a game with initial capital 2, and in the $k$'th 
game we either win or loose $a_k$ with probability 0.5. In this game we allow the player to 
have a negative capital. Some of the interesting questions are:

* What is the distribution of the capital after $n$ games?
* What happens to the distribution of the capital when $n \to \infty$?
* What happens to the capital in a single game when $n \to \infty$? 
Will it continue to fluctuate or will it stabilize?
* What is the probability that the player will have a negative capital eventually?
