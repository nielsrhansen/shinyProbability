The simulation
--------------

In the simulation above you can choose the sequence $a_k$, 
its length $n$, and you can also simulate more than one sequence. You can 
generate a new sequence of random signs by pressing the *resimulate* button. 

The default plot is the **sample path** of a single realization with $n = 50$ and all 
the $a_k$'s being 1. The result is a symmetric random walk. To get an impression of the 
distribution of $S_{50}$ increase the number of sequences to get multiple sample paths. You 
can get a better impression of the single sample paths by connecting the points. Try to answer the 
following questions.

* For which choices of $a_k$-sequence will $S_n$ stabilize?
* Give, based on the simulation, an educated guess on the probability that $S_n$ will become negative 
eventually.
