The simulation
--------------

For this simulation you can choose the distribution of $X_k$. The choices are the normal 
distribution with mean 0 and varians 1, the exponential distribution with rate 1, the $t$-distribution with
2 degrees of freedom, the Cauchy distribution and the Poisson distribution with mean 1. 

The figures show the sequence(s) of random variables $X_n$ and the sample path for the 
mean $S_n / n$. You can generate multiple sample paths by changing the number of replications.
The almost sure convergence means that each sample path will stabilize and 
converge with probability one. 

* For which of the distributions does the LLN hold?
* For which choices of $f$ does the LLN hold?
* What is the limit in the cases where the LLN holds?
