The simulation
--------------

For this simulation you can choose the distribution of $X_k$. The choices are the normal 
distribution with mean 0 and variance 1, the exponential distribution with rate 1, a $t$-distribution with
2 or 3 degrees of freedom, and the Poisson distribution with mean 1. 

The figures show the sample (or empirical) distribution function, the histogram as well
as PP- and QQ-plots for 500 simulations of 
$$\frac{S_n - n \mu }{\sqrt{n}}.$$
In all cases the sample distribution is compared to the normal distribution with mean 0 and
variance 1. 

* For which of the distributions does the CLT hold?
* Explain the plots for small $n$.
